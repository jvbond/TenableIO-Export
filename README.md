# TenableIO-Export
Python script for exporting Tenable IO vulnerability and asset data.

Create API keys for your user and enter that information into the akey and skey variables

Running this script will create two files in the directory you are working in:
    vulnerabilities.csv - Vulnerability export of the last 90 days
    assets.csv - Asset data export of the last 14 days


ToDo: Collect audit benchmark data
